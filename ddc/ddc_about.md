  <h2> Creation of the IPCC Data Distribution Centre</h2>
  
  <p>	The DDC has been established to facilitate the timely distribution of a consistent set of
  up-to-date scenarios of changes in climate and related environmental and socio-economic factors for
  use in climate impacts assessments. The intention is that these new assessments can feed into the
  review process of the IPCC.</p>
  
  <p>	The initiative to establish a DDC grew out of a recommendation by the
  IPCC Task Group on Data and Scenario Support for Impact and Climate Analysis (TGICA).
  This Task Group was itself formed following a recommendation made at the IPCC Workshop on
  Regional Climate Change Projections for Impact Assessment (London, 24-26 September 1996).
At its 47th Session in March 2018, the Panel decided to rename TGICA the
 <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/task-group-on-data-and-scenario-support-for-impact-and-climate-analysis-tgica">
Task Group on Data Support for Climate Change Assessments (TG-DATA)
</a>.  </p>
  
  <p>	The establishment of the DDC was approved by the IPCC Bureau at its Thirteenth session
  (9-11 July 1997) and it was subsequently determined at the XIIIth IPCC Plenary (Maldives, 22-28
  September 1997) that the DDC would be a shared operation between the
  <a href="http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk" target="new">Climatic Research Unit (CRU)</a> in the
  United Kingdom and the Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum (DKRZ) in Germany. In 2003 a third centre,
  the <a href="http://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/" target="new">Center for International Earth Science
  Information Network (CIESIN)</a> in the USA, joined the DDC collaboration.
  From February 1st, 2007 the British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC) (which later became the
<a href="http://ceda.ac.uk" target="new">Centre for Environmental Data Analysis - CEDA</a>)
  has replaced CRU as the United Kingdom partner.</p>
  
<h2>TG-Data and DDC Governance</h2>  
  
  <p>At its 47th Session on 13-16 March 2018, the IPCC adopted Decision IPCC-XLVII-9 whereupon TGICA was 
  renamed as the Task Group on Data Support for Climate Change Assessments (TG-Data). 
  TG-Data aims to provide guidance to the IPCC’s Data Distribution Centre (DDC) on curation, traceability, 
  stability, availability and transparency of data and scenarios related to the reports of the IPCC. 
  Together with the DDC, the Task Group facilitates the availability and consistent use of climate 
  change-related data and scenarios in support of the implementation of the IPCC’s programme of work.
